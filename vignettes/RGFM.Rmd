## Install the GFM
This vignette provides an introduction to the R package `GFM`, where the function `gfm` implements the model `GFM`, Generalized Factor Model for ultra-high dimensional variables with mixed types. The estimated factors and loading matrices can be applied to a variaty of downstream analyses, such as cell type clustering in single cell RNA sequencing data analysis and important SNPs identification in GWAS data analysis, among others.

The package can be installed with the command:

`library(remotes)`

`remotes::install_github("feiyoung/GFM")`

or

`install.packages("GFM")`

The package can be loaded with the command:
```{r  eval=FALSE}
library("GFM")
```
